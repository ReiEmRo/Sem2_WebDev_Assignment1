# From Semester 2 WebDev class at SAIT of the ITSD program.

## `Part A`
Part A is a single page `HTML` that basically lists out 3 Canadian Architects biography along with several pictures of their creations.\
This assignment was our first attempt at playing around with css and image wrapping beteen texts.

## `Part B`
Part B is a single page `HTML` paired with `JavaScript` created to read and calculate user inputs.\
This assignment required us to read and validate user inputs as well as calculating a total amount\
before printing a receipt at the bottom of the page.

## `How to Run`
You can use any IDE of your choice as long as \
each project is ran using a live server separately.
