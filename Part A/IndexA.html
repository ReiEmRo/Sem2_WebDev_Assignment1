			Arthur Charles Erickson, architect (b at Vancouver, BC 14 June 1924, d at Vancouver 20 May 2009). Erickson studied at UBC and McGill and completed his architectural training in 1950. Army service took him to Asia, and after graduation he travelled in Europe and the Middle East. In partnership with Geoffrey Massey he began private practice in Vancouver in 1953; their success in the design competition for SFU in 1963 brought them international attention.

			A series of major commissions followed, including theme buildings at Expo 67 in Montréal; the MacMillan Bloedel office tower in Vancouver in 1969; the Canadian Pavilion, Expo 70, Osaka, Japan; U of Lethbridge, 1971; the Museum of Anthropology at UBC, 1971-77; the provincial government offices and courthouse (and Vancouver Art Gallery) complex, begun in 1973; the Bank of Canada, Ottawa, 1980, in association with Marani, Rounthwaite & Dick; and Roy Thomson Hall, Toronto, 1982.

		<p>
			Erickson also received numerous commissions from Middle Eastern countries, South America and the US, where he was architect for the Canadian embassy in Washington (opened May 1989). Among many awards and honours, Erickson received the Royal Bank Award (1971) and the Chicago Architectural Award (1984, with Philip Johnson and Joan Burgee); as well, he received gold medals from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (1984) and the American Institute of Architects (1986).
		</p>
		<p>
			Perhaps the first Canadian architect to be widely known by the international public, he gained wide popular regard for his ability to create dramatic places with apparently simple means. A consistent theme through many of his buildings is the framing portal of horizontal beam on vertical columns, a welcoming and sheltering motif found in West Coast Native buildings, but which also looks back to the architecture of ancient Greece. Such restricted means, with muted colours, are used in his best buildings to create a sense of place and occasion. They also provide the means to create buildings integral to the landscapes in which they are placed.

		<p>
			Some work of the 1980s demonstrates an explicit response to historic forms and precedents. The restraint and sensitivity which informed the design of the Puget Sound House (1983-86) is an example of such a response, as is the Canadian Chancery, Washington (1983-88) where the city's neo-classical traditions suggested important themes. His unsuccessful entry in the 1988 Chicago Library competition fell away from this high standard, perhaps reflecting an uncertain mood during the peak of "post-modern" attacks on the modernism of which Erickson has been such a distinguished exponent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Erickson's international design success rested on his ability to attract and lead talented associates in widely separated offices (Vancouver, Toronto, Los Angeles, Abu Dhabi). Management of his business affairs was not as successful. Financial problems in the late 1980s led to the closing of his offices (in 1989 and 1991). He continued to live and work in Vancouver, practising in association with established Vancouver firms.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was named a companion of the Order of Canada in 1981.

		<hr><h2>Douglas Cardinal</h2>

		<p>
			Douglas Joseph Cardinal, architect (born 7 March 1934 in Calgary, AB). Recognized for his commitment to excellence and his unique creative vision, Cardinal is credited with creating an Indigenous style of Canadian architecture, characterized by gracious organic forms, which continually challenged the most advanced engineering standards.

		<h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
		<p>
			Siksika (Blackfoot) ancestry who was a forest ranger and game warden, and Frances Margarete Rach, a nurse, who was the daughter of a German immigrant and a member of the Morin family, a large Métis clan, Douglas Cardinal was the eldest of eight children. He grew up in mainstream communities and attended St Joseph's Convent Residential School near Red Deer, AB, where he was immersed in literature, and the fine arts of drawing and music.
		</p>
		<p>
			Accepted by the School of Architecture at the University of British Columbia in 1952, he studied there for three years. It was the University of Texas School of Architecture at Austin that provided the intellectually open, yet rigorous, training he needed to develop the complex, undulating architecture for which he is now internationally acclaimed. He graduated with honours in 1963.

		<h3>Architectural Style</h3>
		<p>
			Like many of the renowned Western Canadian architects developing during the 1950s, Douglas Cardinal sought to interpret the teachings of European modernism by investigating a regional modification of the International Style. He was particularly influenced by Antonio Gaudi, Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier. His mature work harmonizes an attraction to Italian and Spanish baroque buildings with the expressionist arm of European modern architecture that reached its ascendancy in Germany just after the First World War.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cardinal was to synthesize his direct experience of architecture in Western Canada (Prairie expressionism, in particular) and the neo-baroque of Mexican church architecture, which he would encounter during his travels in the late 1950s, with his formal training in architecture and the history of architecture. This knowledge merged with his experience of the terrain of Western Canada, in particular the Plains and Alberta’s badlands, in the development of the curvilinear massing that is a signatory feature of his buildings.
		</p>

			<img src="douglas_cardinal/Provincial_building.jpg" alt="One of Arthus Erickson's Designs">
			<figcaption>Provincial Building</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			In Cardinal's architecture, principles of seamless unity, sustainability, community, green buildings and ecological design are interwoven with his strong sense for nature. The resulting designs are typified in award-winning projects such as St. Mary’s Church in Red Deer, AB (1965–68). His desire to integrate his architecture with these principles brought on experimentation with Computer-Aided Drafting and Design systems (CADD). It was during the construction of St. Mary's that the Cardinal firm began using CADD.
		</p>
		<p>
			By 1981, he was identified as a world pioneer and leader of CADD, and his firm was selected by the federal government as a demonstration site to test and advance Canadian CADD technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			Douglas Cardinal's principal public buildings include Grande Prairie Regional College in Grande Prairie, AB (1972–76), the Alberta Government Services Building at Ponoka (1977), and the St. Albert Civic and Cultural Centre at St. Albert, AB (1984, as well as numerous schools, all of which continued the curving wall exterior adapted to ever-increasing complex functional programs.

		<h3>Indigenous-Style Architecture</h3>
		<p>
			Throughout the 1990s, Cardinal undertook a leadership role by providing architectural definition to the aims and aspirations of Indigenous communities. These projects included, among others: the Institute of American Indian Arts master plan, Santa Fe, New Mexico (1993); a master plan and design of principal public buildings for the Cree Village of Oujé-Bougoumou in Northern Québec (1994, which earned a United Nation's Award of Excellence for its sustainable designs and was celebrated at Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany; Kainai Middle School, Blood Indian Reserve, AB (1995); and the Saskatchewan Federated Indian College (now First Nations University) master plan and concept design for expansion, Regina, SK (2003).
		</p>
		<p>
			One of Cardinal's first projects outside Alberta and the Northwest Territories brought Prairie expressionism to central Canada through the design for the Canadian Museum of Civilization (now Canadian Museum of History) in Hull, Québec, inaugurated in 1989. Acknowledged internationally as a technologically complex building that reframed museum architecture, the CMC is a culturally significant building that was designed to accommodate a shifting perspective on Indigenous history and national culture at the end of the 20th century.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1993, Cardinal was awarded the commission for the National Museum of the American Indian on the National Mall in Washington, DC, which resulted in an outstanding design, finished after Cardinal's exclusion from the project and surrounded by controversy.

		</figure>
		<p>
			Other accomplishments include the design of the Cree Cultural Institute (2011) in Québec and the Meno Ya Win Health Centre (2010) in Northern Ontario. His works include several master plans, a student centre at the University of Saskatchewan, a stadium in Regina and prefabricated/modular housing. Cardinal has also designed a gallery to house the permanent collection of the great Indigenous artist Alex Janvier in Cold Lake, AB. These projects show how Cardinal's material palette has become much more varied, revealing his willingness to continually explore.
		</p>
		<h3>Awards and Honours</h3>
		<p>
			In 1990, Douglas Cardinal was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was awarded the Canada Council Molson Prize for the Arts in 1992 and the National Aboriginal Achievement Award in 1995. In 1999, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, the highest architectural honour bestowed upon an individual in Canada. He was awarded the Governor General's Award for Visual and Media Arts in 2001. In 2002, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and the Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. By 2013, he had been granted over 12 honorary doctorates (by every major Canadian university) in recognition of his significant contribution to excellence in architecture.
			Douglas Cardinal Collections

		<hr><h2>Moshe Safdie</h2>

			Moshe Safdie, CC, architect, professor, urban planner, educator, theorist, author (born 14 July 1938 in Haifa, Palestine [now Israel]).
		</p>

		<h3>National Gallery, Corridor 1</h3>
		<p>
			Moshe Safdie, CC, architect, professor, urban planner, educator, theorist, author (born 14 July 1938 in Haifa, Palestine [now Israel]). A Companion of the Order of Canada, Moshe Safdie’s architectural designs include residential housing, galleries, fine arts complexes, parks, airports, museums, colleges, libraries, government buildings, memorials, masterplans and multi-use complexes. He is perhaps best known in Canada for the Habitat 67 housing complex in Montréal, the National Gallery in Ottawa and Vancouver Library Square. Safdie’s influence is wide reaching, covering nearly 100 projects on five continents. His Boston-based office has extended its branches to Jerusalem, Toronto, Singapore and Shanghai.
		</p>	
		
		<h3>Education and Early Career</h3>
		<p>
			Safdie moved with his family to Montréal in 1953. He was educated at McGill University, where he graduated in 1961. After apprenticing with American architect Louis Kahn in Philadelphia, he returned to Montréal in 1964 to oversee the realization of his student thesis: the Habitat 67 model housing complex built for Expo 67 in Montréal, which earned Safdie the 1967 Construction Man of the Year Award from Engineering News Record and the Massey Medal for Architecture. Habitat 67 was also named a historic monument by the government of Québec in 2009.

		<h3>Major Works in Canada</h3>
		<p>
			Although based in Boston, Massachusetts, since 1978, Safdie has continued to design Canadian projects. His increasing interest in historical, formal and contextual issues is evident in his Canadian designs from the 1980s on, such as the major expansion of Ottawa City Hall (1994), which respects the much admired earlier building designed by Rother, Bland and Trudeau in 1958, and his 1995 design for Vancouver Library Square. The latter confronts the clutter of a decayed downtown setting with a powerful elliptical form reminiscent of the Roman Coliseum. Curving doubled and windowed walls enclose a covered plaza with shops and the library entrance, as well as the rectangular library building itself. The library building, set within the elliptical enclosure, contrasts a modernist glass and metal vocabulary with the attached columns and horizontal bands, which articulate the curved brown concrete walls to give it a distinctly archaic character. This collection of large public buildings use extensive glazed areas, emphasizing Safdie’s belief that light in architecture is integral and has a value beyond the functional, blending the interior with the exterior and inviting those outside in.
		</p>
		<p>
			Safdie’s other major works in Canada include the National Gallery of Canada (1988), Ottawa; the Musée de la Civilisation (for which he received a Governor General's Award for Architecture in 1992), Québec City; renovations and a major addition to the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts (1991); and the new terminal at Lester B. Pearson Airport (2007), Toronto, in a joint venture with Adamson Associates and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Among his latest such Canadian projects is a major residential project for Toronto, Parkside Residential Development.
		</p>

		<h3>International Work</h3>
		<figure class="textWrapRight">
			<img src="moshe_safdie/moshe-safdi_bsa.jpg" alt="One of Arthus Erickson's Designs">
			<figcaption>One of Moshe Safdie's Designs</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Moshe Safdie and Associates has become a major international practice with projects in many countries, notably Israel, where Safdie designed the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum (2005) in Jerusalem and the Ben Gurion International Airport (2004) in Tel Aviv. He has designed many buildings in the US as well, among them the United States Institute of Peace Headquarters (2011) in Washington, DC, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (2011) in Bentonville, Arkansa, and the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts (2011) in Kansas City, Missouri.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the larger world stage are projects such as the Khalsa Heritage Centre (2011) in Anandpur Sahib, India, and the astonishing design for the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort (2011) in Singapore. This mixed-use complex, which has been referred to as a colossal Stonehenge, contains a 55-storey hotel, convention centre and exhibition facilities, while its profile appears as though a gigantic canoe or curved sled has been perched atop three unconventional, curved towers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Safdie has created other designs in Jerusalem, Mexico City, Singapore, Tehran, India, China and Puerto Rico. This international portfolio has allowed him to exploree his design ideas on unprecedented scales.

		</figure>
		<h3>Trademark Approach</h3>
		<p>
			Beginning with Habitat 67, and developing into lighter and more economical versions, Safdie has explored prefabricated concrete assemblies of cellular multi-unit housing. These cellular units create diverse, irregular, informal groupings; the images created recall the medieval hill towns of Europe and the densely packed traditional cities of North Africa and the Middle East. Safdie refined this type of community building in a high-density residential community for middle class families he created in Qinhuangdao, China. Called Golden Dream Bay, it is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. A garden, as studied formally in Habitat 67, is integral to each housing unit, yet the complexity of the overall project shows immense refinement since the Habitat project.
		</p>

		<h3>Teaching</h3>
		<p>
			In addition to writing extensively about his work, Safdie has also taught at McGill University, Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Beer-Sheva, Israel, and at Yale University. From 1978 to 1984, he was director of the Urban Design program at Harvard University, where he continued as the Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban Design until 1989. Safdie constantly revisits his ideas about people and places, planning and site context as well as the design process. His book For Everyone a Garden(1974) still serves as a reference in his offices today.
		</p>

		<h3>“Global Citizen”</h3>
		<figure class="textWrapRight">
			<img src="moshe_safdie/sky-habitat.jpg" alt="One of Arthus Erickson's Designs">
			<figcaption>Sky Habitat by Moshe Safdie</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			A 2010–11 exhibition that premiered at Canada's National Gallery and subsequently travelled to the US characterized Safdie as a "global citizen." His projects speak volumes of his desire to understand cultures, people and to create a more humane architecture. He has been featured in Donald Winkler’s documentary Moshe Safdie: The Power of Architecture (2004), which highlights his visionary successes over the course of his career. The sheer number and diversity of Safdie's projects prompted one commentator in the film to remark, "Whoever said we mellow with age obviously hadn't met Moshe Safdie. The Israeli-Canadian architect continues to work on grand projects at a prodigious rate, while remaining an outspoken critic of the shortcomings and blind spots of current architectural practice."
		</p>
		<h3>Honours</h3>
		<p>
			Moshe Safdie was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1986 and promoted to Companion in 2005. The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) named him to its College of Fellows in 1982, and awarded him the RAIC Gold Medal in 1995, the year he also became a fellow of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Other AIA awards include a 1993 Honor Award for the Harvard Business School Class of 1959, and an Institute Honor Award for the Salt Lake City Public Library in 2004. The RAIC's Prix du XXe siècle, recognizing enduring excellence in nationally significant architecture, was awarded to Safdie in 2007 for his design for Habitat 67. His architectural documents are held at the McGill University Archives.
